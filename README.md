# FabriChain

FabriChain is a concept of offering a customer who is shopping for clothes the ability to read information regarding the supply chain of the clothing product.
The information can be secured and valid by being stored on a blockchain. 

This information can show where materials are sourced from and from which companies so that customers can be aware if the clothing or retail company they buy from is being sustainable,ecological and/or is consious about the worker rights of the companies they source materials from. 

For higher-end brands there is the added benefit of the customer knowing they have a product that is not counterfeit, since its id will be uniquely saved on the blockchain (proof).

## Code Stack

Being a concept, the frontend does not matter too much, hence thymeleaf was used. Java is used for the blockchain to ensure everything is organized in class hierarchies and proper datatypes.
